# .obj to .mesh
This is a lua implementation of converting a wavefront file to a .mesh file for Roblox meshes. If you want to try to attempt to create your own, see MeshExtNotes.txt

## How to convert:
 1. Populate file `in.txt` with the wavefront content. (Since wavefronts are human readable, it should be easy to open and copy.)
 2. Run the batch file, check if it the command prompt has `done`, if not run again once more.
 3. Copy file `out.mesh` and paste it somewhere.
